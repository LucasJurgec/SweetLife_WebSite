#  Sweet Life – Ice Cream Business Website

**Sweet Life** is a static website project I created to showcase a fictional ice cream business. Built using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, this site presents a clean and user-friendly design for a dessert brand, including product features, a registration form, and an ordering system.

This project was originally created as part of a university assignment and later migrated from Swinburne’s Mercury server to GitHub Pages.
